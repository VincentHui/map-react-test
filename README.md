This application uses a local JSON file to load client information, then structures them into a hierarchy of countries > cities > companies. This project uses the package `styled-components` for css in js, the google Maps Embed Api and uses React classes instead of hooks. Use `yarn install` to get the needed packages and `yarn start` to start the application locally.
